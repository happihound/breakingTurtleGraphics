# breakingTurtleGraphics

## Description

breakingTurtleGraphics is a Python program that takes an image and converts it into a list of lines, with a color included, and draws them using Python turtle graphics. In this project, we used two images, Starry Night by Van Gogh and Abbey Road album cover by The Beatles. You can find these images in the example folder.

After running the program, you will get a new image, which is a visual representation of the lines from the original image. You can find the resulting images in the output_images folder.
